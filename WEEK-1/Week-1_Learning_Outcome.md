# Week-1: Microcontroller Boards

This week focuses on the fundamentals of popular microcontroller boards and how to interact with them through development tools and communication protocols.

## Topics Covered

- **Arduino Uno**
  - Understand the types of pins on the Arduino Uno (digital, analog, power, reset, etc.) and their functions.

- **ESP32 Pinout**
  - Reference: *The Ultimate Guide to the ESP32 Pinout* by StudioPieters.

- **Programming on Arduino IDE**
  - Setting up the IDE for Arduino Uno and ESP32.
  - Writing basic sketches, compiling, and uploading to boards.

- **Serial Communication and the Serial Monitor**
  - Use the Serial Monitor for debugging and data display.

- **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Protocol**
  - Understand how I2C enables communication between master and slave devices.
  - Explore address structure, wiring, and real-world applications.

- **Simulators**
  - Use online platforms like:
    - **Wokwi** (for Arduino/ESP32 simulation)
    - **TinkerCad** (for simple Arduino circuit design and simulation)
